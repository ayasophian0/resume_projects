This project involves predicting employee churn using an HR dataset. I performed **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to identify key factors influencing turnover and applied **clustering algorithms** to segment the workforce. I then developed and optimized **machine learning** and **deep learning** models to predict churn, providing insights for improving employee retention.
