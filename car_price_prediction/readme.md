ðŸš— Car Price Prediction

Worked with a highly unstructured dataset from an online car sales platform, cleaning and refining it for machine learning. Engineered features, applied Linear Regression with Lasso and Ridge regularization, and optimized the model through hyperparameter tuning. Finally, deployed the price prediction model using Streamlit.
