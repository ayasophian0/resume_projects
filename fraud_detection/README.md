ðŸ’³ **Fraud Detection**

This project focuses on detecting fraud using **extremely imbalanced** banking data. I built **classification models** and optimized their performance through **over- and under-sampling techniques**, along with **model tuning** and **calibration** to improve accuracy and reduce false positives.
